3,3,Violence,"would we resort to cannibalism if all animals somehow magically disappeared ? when i read a novel which stated that all humans would resort to cannibalism after every animal contracted an unusual disease which rendered them dangerous to consume , i was amazed . the author contended that in the absence of animal meat , humans would soon start consuming one another to survive . although the novel was engaging , i could not concur with the notion . yes , during a few desperate and unusual circumstances throughout history , individuals have turned to cannibalism . but to suggest it would be the natural , day - to - day solution for all of mankind seemed unrealistic and unjust . there are obvious reasons why this would not occur . for one , consuming human flesh is greatly unsafe . it can transmit fatal diseases , particularly prion diseases that cooking cannot kill . human flesh is also not an effective or sustainable food source since it is scarce and risky , and would just bring about more death . second , cannibalism would destroy the trust and cooperation necessary for humans to get through difficult times . societies endure by cooperating , not by destroying each other . rather , individuals could look to numerous other food sources like plants farming , mushroom growing , algae cultivation , or even microbes to produce protein . all these are healthier , safer , and much more sustainable . the book also presupposed that during periods of famine , human beings always lose their ethics and become violent . i don't think that is the case . history has proven that during most crises , humans tend to unite to share what they have , take care of each other , and come up with innovative solutions . in my opinion , human strength is in collaboration and innovation , not giving up and hurting each other . that is why i disagree with the assertion in the book that cannibalism would be our destiny if animals could no longer be consumed . what do you guys think about this ? would individuals truly resort to cannibalism here , or would they discover better and more collaborative means of survival ?",reddit,True

204,4,Discriminatory_speech,"cmv : a historical jesus existed . laying the foundations what do i mean by 'historical' jesus ? firstly , i need to establish what i mean by historical jesus because people on both sides of the debate tend to get confused . by saying a historical jesus existed , i am saying that there existed a jewish man in first century palestine , who : was known as jesus of nazareth who was baptized who was crucified who had a following who saw him as the messiah i am not saying jesus was did any of the following : performed miracles rose from the dead the son of god a divine being with that out of the way , let's look at three of ( what i consider ) the strongest reasons for his existence . three strong reasons for his existence 1 . paul met with the apostle peter and james , jesus's brother . if jesus didn't exist , he would not have had a brother . in paul s epistle to the galatians , written c . ad 48 50 , paul writes : then after three years i went up to jerusalem to visit alphas peter , and remained with him fifteen days . but i saw none of the other apostles except james the lord s brother . galatians 1 : 18 19 ( esv ) it is difficult to be the brother of someone who does t exist . if jesus never existed , you would think his brother would know that . paul started writing around 15 years after jesus s death , well before the gospels and well within the timeframe to meet peter and james . this is not a random , theological vision : this is a first - hand in - person account of a contemporary figure ( alive at the same time as jesus ) , paul , meeting with alphas ( peter ) and james . he meets them multiple times . as far as ancient sources go , this is about as good as it gets . common mythicist bushbuck 1 : the lord's brother is a spiritual title . there is no evidence to suggest that the phrase the lord s brother is a spiritual title like brother in christ , as paul uses different language elsewhere to refer to christians as brothers . paul frequently calls fellow believers brothers , but he never calls anyone else the lord s brother . if it were a routine spiritual title , it would appear elsewhere . it doesn't . it also does t make sense for paul to imply that james was jesus s spiritual brother but peter was not . common mythicist bushbuck 2 : james and peter made up jesus there is no evidence to suggest this . is it possible ? sure . but many things are possible . it's possible that a monk in the 12 th century forged all the manuscripts we have today . but there's nothing to go on . there is no evidence to suggest james and peter made up jesus . that aside , james making up jesus is historically implausible . if james invented jesus , he would have had to 1 . invent his own brother , 2 . claim that this non - existent brother was publicly crucified by the romans , and 3 . convince many others ( including former enemies like paul ) of this fabrication . in the period before his conversion , paul had no incentive to buy into james s story . he persecuted the early church before converting ( galatians 1 : 13 - 14 , philippians 3 : 6 ) . in fact , he downplays his meeting with james and peter , basically saying : i barely saw anyone . just peter and james . i was there for two weeks . if james was t really jesus s brother , someone would ve said so , especially paul , who often disagreed with james s faction ( see galatians 2 ) . as bart herman puts it : the historical man jesus from nazareth had a brother named james . paul actually knew him . that is pretty darn good evidence that jesus existed . if he did not exist he would not have had a brother . 2 . multiple independent sources ( paul , josephus , tacitus ) reference jesus . when separate , unrelated sources independently attest to the same event or person , it greatly increases confidence that the person or event is historical . in the case of jesus , we have three major , independent sources , both christian and non - christian , that refer to jesus within seventy years of each other : paul ( c . 48 - 64 ad ) , josephus ( c . 93 - 94 ad ) , and tacitus ( c . 115 to 117 ad ) . paul , josephus , and tacitus were of different groups ( a christian , a jew , and a roman , respectively ) , were writing for different audiences ( churches , educated romans and greeks , roman elites ) , and for different purposes . multiple independent sources converging on the existence of the same figure , with a consistent core of details , within only a few decades , makes outright invention very unlikely . paul of tarsus ( c . 48 to 64 ad ) firstly , paul is not 'the bible' . the idea of the bible or the new testament wouldn't come until centuries later . unlike the gospels ( which i would label 'the bible' ) , his letters were personal , occasional writings to early christian communities - not narrative accounts designed to give a biography of jesus like the gospels were . paul s letters are among the earliest christian documents , written within 15 to 30 years of jesus s death ( well within living memory of other people ) . paul says several things about jesus , and does not just describe a mystical or spiritual jesus - he refers to specific events in jesus s earthly life : jesus was born of a woman - galatians 4 : 4 he had brothers ( especially james ) - galatians 1 : 19 he was descended from david - romans 1 : 3 he had a last supper - 1 corinthians 11 : 23 - 25 he was betrayed - 1 corinthians 11 : 24 he was crucified - 1 corinthians 2 : 2 ; galatians 3 : 1 he was buried - 1 corinthians 15 : 4 he had disciples apostles - galatians 2 : 7 - 9 , 1 corinthians 15 : 5 paul s letters provide direct , early , and relational evidence for jesus s existence written by someone who was t a gullible follower from the start , but a hostile outsider convinced by evidence and encounter . clavius josephus c . 93 - 94 ad clavius josephus ( c . 37 ad - 100 ad ) was a jewish historian who in his work antiquities of the jews ( written c . 93 - 94 ad ) provided two references to jesus . in the first of these , josephus writes : fetus was now dead , and albinus was but upon the road ; so he assembled the sanhedrin of judges , and brought before them the brother of jesus , who was called christ , whose name was james , and some others ; and when he had formed an accusation against them as breakers of the law , he delivered them to be stoned . ( ant . 20 . 200 ) like paul s reference in galatians 1 : 19 , if jesus did not exist , he would not have a brother . here , the label is not 'a brother of jesus' , but the brother . this passage is significant because josephus is referring to a historical event ( the execution of james ) , something that happened within his adult life . he was not contextually disconnected from jesus , either ; he was a general in the place where jesus ministered and people who knew him still lived , galilee . he also dwelled near jesus's hometown of nazareth for a time , and kept contact with groups such as the sanhedrin and bananas ii who were involved in the trials of jesus and his brother james . if jesus was t a real person , josephus would be in a position to know . unlike the second reference he makes to jesus , testimonies flavianum , which mythicist love to go on about , the manuscript tradition of this passage is secure , found in the greek texts of josephus without any notable variation ( although the testimonies flavianum is not entirely useless as evidence ) . also unlike the testimonies flavianum , the reference to jesus is made on the side ; jesus is only mentioned as a point of identification for james , not the focus for embellishment . tacitus ( c . 115 to 117 ad ) tacitus ( c . 56 - 120 ad ) was a roman historian who made a passing reference to jesus in annals xv . 44 , speaking of the great fire of rome which occurred in 64 ad . he writes : consequently , to get rid of the report , nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations , called christians by the populace . christ's , from whom the name had its origin , suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of tiberius at the hands of one of our procurators , pontus pilatus , and a most mischievous superstition , thus checked for the moment , again broke out not only in jud a , the first source of the evil , but even in rome , where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their center and become popular . tacitus references a christ's , giving four key pieces of information about him : that he was the founder of the christian sect , that he founded the sect in judea , that he was executed by pontus pilatus , and that this occurred during the reign of tiberius ( 14 to 37 ad ) . if that isn't jesus , then i don't know who else it is . common mythicist bushbuck 1 : tacitus is just repeating what christians said about him . a common criticism of this passage is that tacitus is merely repeating what christians say . however , there s no indication he relied on christian sources . he makes his disdain for accepting hearsay elsewhere in his writings very clear , saying : my object in mentioning and refuting this story is , by a conspicuous example , to put down hearsay , and to request that all those into whose hands my work shall come not to catch eagerly at wild and improbable rumors in preference to genuine history . ( annals , iv . 11 ) this is strong evidence that tacitus , when he does t frame something as rumor , believes it to be based on solid knowledge . whenever he refers to things that were said or reported , he is careful to do so , such as in annals 1 . 76 , annals ii . 40 , annals xii . 7 , and annals xii . 65 . he does t cite christians , does t frame the information as their claim ( christians say ) , and his tone is openly hostile . tacitus was a roman elite with access to imperial records , official memory , and common knowledge among the ruling class and he presents jesus s execution under pilate as a matter of fact , not belief . tacitus is a relatively minor part of a wider argument for jesus s existence , but tacitus is a big deal to mythicist because they disregard any christian writings as not historical so they only have to explain away tacitus and josephus . historians , however , treat early christian writings as important historical writings because they are , in fact , important historical writings . which leads into the next reason . 3 . if jesus was an invented figure , they would not have had him be crucified . the jewish people in first century palestine were awaiting a messiah . there was various expectations of what the messiah would do , but there was one thing almost all the different jewish groups had in common about the messiah . jews who expected the messiah expected a great , powerful figure who would destroy the enemy and set up god's kingdom on earth . and who did the christians say jesus was ? a crucified criminal . if jesus had been an invented figure , the earliest christians would not have portrayed him as crucified . crucifixion in first - century palestine was a shameful punishment reserved for criminals and rebels , the opposite of prevailing jewish expectations for the messiah . as paul himself says in 1 corinthians 1 : 23 , jesus being crucified was a stumbling block to jews . many jews did not convert because they thought that the messiah wouldn't be a crucified criminal . the most plausible explanation is that jesus actually suffered crucifixion , and his followers then interpreted this event within their belief that he was god s anointed . there are many others attributes about jesus which make very little sense to make up about him unless they actually happened ( such as the baptism ) , but the crucifixion is the most glaring . rebuttals to other common talking points 1 . none of this actually proves jesus existed . you are right . none of this 'proves' jesus existed . the only way to prove jesus existed is to go back in a time machine and meet him . historians don't use the term 'proof' . we cannot 'prove' any figure existed with 100 certainty . but what we can do is we can look at the available evidence and the available facts that we do have and come to a conclusion on that . that conclusion is : jesus very likely existed . 2 . we have no contemporary greek roman references to jesus we also have no contemporary greek roman references to caiaphas , who was one of the most significant religious leader of the time , who was in a far more elite and influential position than jesus , and neither is josephus who is one of the best documented figures of the first century . so why would jesus be ? a follow up to this is that well if he was performing all the miracles , surely that would be noteworthy . i'm not talking about the miracles . i'm not talking about walking on water or feeding the 5000 or healing the blind . there is no evidence any these things happened . unless they actually happened , there is no reason to expect people to be reporting on them . jesus - a figure who is not much more significant than any other jew at the time - has no reason to be mentioned . 3 . there's nothing on him for 40 years . before you accuse me of building a strawman , a very common statement on certain debate subedits ( not sure if i'm allowed to name them ) is there's nothing on jesus for 40 years . firstly , this is flat out wrong : we have paul writing 15 years later . secondly , paul's meeting with peter and james took place about 5 years after the events . is it in the middle of the action ? no . but it is much closer than 40 years . thirdly , it has been proposed that the gospel of mark was written in the 40 s ( such as by james crosslet ) . i don't personally think this is likely , but if it was true , then it challenges there's nothing on jesus for 40 years . as for why there are no contemporary references , it is probable that the followers of jesus thought he would be coming back relatively soon . as proposed by scholar richard buckram , it is only when they realized he wasn't coming back ( and eyewitnesses were thinning out ) that people started writing things down . 4 . so what ? all this gets you is that maybe there was a guy named jesus who existed . that doesn't make the religion or anything true . you are right . it doesn't . but as i have stated several times , that is not what i am arguing . i am arguing that , as i said at the start , there existed a jewish man in first century palestine , who : was known as jesus of nazareth who was baptized who was crucified who had a following who his followers saw as the messiah no miracles , resurrection , etc , needed . edit : i don't expect many responses to this post to be genuine or more than puppy one - liners , but for the few who do want an honest conversation , i'll happily engage .",reddit,True
205,5,Discriminatory_speech,"cmv : we need to admit marx was right about capitalism and find a solution as soon as possible everything marx has said has come true . 1 ) if workers do not organize , the capitalists will worsen conditions since the 1980 s when the user collapsed , regardless of how bad the user was , the real wage across the world has stagnated . housing is bloated and more expensive . healthcare sucks . in the global south people are working in sweat shop factories and mines in inhumane conditions . things felt better under capitalism before , because the workers had fought for better rights in the 1930 s . but since the 1980 s they've been slowly but surely worsening it . but even then , tactics that used to work before might not necessarily work . there's so many workers now who need housing who's going to make enough jobs that pay a living wage to get them ? who's gonna increasing building of housing if rich property owners have so much power they can block affordable housing ? what about times when capitalism absolutely crashed and there should've been at least a tiny reform ? like in 2008 or 2020 ? why have we not gotten shit since then , no matter how hard it fails ? because class consciousness and worker rights are much weaker than they used to be . and marx was right that workers should be as powerful as possible and expect to fight for things . the only solution is socialism . 2 ) economics isn't empirical nor objective the last few years how many times have we heard talk about the gdp being incredibly high and growing ? or unemployment being so low ? economists have changed what we should value as a society into metrics no one should care about . just because your doing user for 70 hours a week and employed and adding to the gdp isn't a good thing . it's bad . that's not a life . the subjective labor theory of value has also had more evidence for being true than before . thanks to advanced record keeping , anyone ( including you , try this right now ) can graph a io table for each country online by industry and monetary value and see a 90 link between labor hours and value , proving marx right . 3 ) overconsumption is destroying the world the world is structured to encourage overconsumption . cars are made to be large , expensive , and wasteful . public transportation doesn't get any funding . housing is getting bigger and more and more expensive despite not needing it like that . the people in the west also consume waylay too much . if everyone on earth lived like americans , we would need three planets . is this really what we want to encourage ? behaviors of consumption that are unsupportable in the long term ? can a earth with 10 billion people support that ? 12 billion ? things like social media , while good for connecting , have created an dopamine seeking alienated generation . i know i sound like a boomer . but our parents weren't wrong completely . it's not normal to be like this . we should be more involved in our community . things genuinely were better when the internet wasn't as developed . like early 2000 s . 4 ) wage relations are exploitative , labor alienation is real i genuinely don't know who enjoys their job . and it's because we don't control what we make . the guy who was born into a rich family controls what we make . if there is something you like to do and want to do it for a career , capitalism will find a way to ruin it . 5 ) social democracies are not the solution contrary to popular belief , social democracies aren't some mystical solution . better than the usa for sure , but it's still a constant battle between workers and owners . and they've been winning since the 80 s . even the nordic countries have been trying to privatize their economy more . before you bring up the user , no , we don't have to do the user again obviously things like technology make things like planning easier . ai can replace most admit jobs . and we can still have freedom of speech . the economy doesn't even have to be planned . markets can still be used and be socialist , like yugoslavia and aspects of china today are . so yeah , marx has been more and vindicated as time goes .",reddit,True
206,6,Discriminatory_speech,"cmv : nothing is good or bad by nature i don't hold this view view firmly . it's more that as far as i can tell , it doesn't seem evident that things are good or bad by nature . when i say by nature , i mean in both an objective sense and a metaphysical sense . i should add that this doesn't mean i'm a moral antirealist . i'm not making the claim that objective moral facts don't exist , but that we ( apparently ) cannot know whether moral realism is true or false , and thus whether moral antirealism is true or false . personally , i wish i were a moral realist . it would be quite convenient to be able to show someone that moral claims are objectively true or objectively false . i just don't know of any way to justify the existence of moral facts nondogmatically . here's my reasoning : 1 . nobody seems to agree on which ethical theory is the correct one . virtue ethicist , gerontologists , and consequentiality have been debating for centuries and no clear consensus has been established . 2 . this begs the question , which of these theories is the correct one ? by which criterion can we decide ? wouldn't we only be able to know the correct criterion for determining the correct ethical theory if we already knew the correct ethical theory ( which we don't ) ? now i want to add : despite not having moral beliefs , this doesn't exclude me from making moral decisions . i can decide i don't belief in something , but i cannot choose not act , as choosing not to act is still an action . though moral facts are not evident to me , empathy and compassion , are evident to me , in addition to the laws and customs of the society i live in . these things are evident because i experience them . even if i don't know whether these things exist objectively outside of my subjective awareness , i cannot deny that they appear to me . it also seems to me that acting on my empathy and compassion , in addition to following the laws and customs of my society - - generally seems to lead to desirable consequences . to act apathetically and cruelly on the other hand , in addition to breaking the laws and customs of my society - - generally seems to lead to undesirable consequences . so despite not having any moral beliefs , i still make moral decisions . i feed my dog , i take her out on walks , i pet her , and i shower her with love . i say please and thank you , i try my best to be kind to others , i put my shopping cart back every time i shop for groceries , i donate , i vote , and i support causes i care about - - not because they're right but because i simply care about them .",reddit,True

? ? ? i told her you just told my husband that i am filled with hate and that i am obsessed , and you told me that i am dividing the family . how can you sit here and talk about family unity when you just said that to me ? i never insulted you , never insulted your character and never criticized your vote . you are more mad at me speaking my mind over the president who specifically said he does not care to unify the country . then she said that i am clearly not ready for an apology and she will leave it at that . ok , whatever . . . later that night , her sister ( my husband's aunt ) also deleted me and also removed my invite for thanksgiving . cool , so now i am suddenly not invited to thanksgiving . then , this started to stress out my husband who started yelling at me because he said that i should have came to him before i ever responded to his mom and even though what i posted was not horrible or insulting at all that he wish i just would have never engaged and this would have never happened and that maybe we should delete all of our social medias . this pissed me off . i reminded him that he very eagerly told me i could defend myself , and i specifically have chosen not to exercise that this entire time until right now . and not only that , i told my husband you post actual divisive things on your snapshot that your mom sees . you call trump supporters morons on your snapshot and your mom sees that . she never comes at you about your posts . your uncle also posts about how trump supporters are morons . she never goes at him either and tells him that maybe he should not post for a month . i want to add some context . i grew up in a very horrible homelike . i was born while my dad was still married to another woman . there was a lot of abuse in my life . my half brother did horrible and unspeakable things to me because my dad ( his step dad ) abused him badly . when my mom left him , we were all homeless and we had to live in a domestic violence home . my mom never believed me about my brother and always cherished and babied him because she felt bad that my dad was so cruel to him . we ended up living in a home for a few years that ended up getting foreclosed on so we were homeless again . by the time i turned 18 , i met my husband and moved in with him . i have been with my husband since 2013 . i have lived with my husband since 2014 . he saved me from my horrible upbringing and i have no relationship with any of my family . why am i bringing this up ? because after my husband and i fought , i did the unspeakable . i brought up the divorce word . my husband is not perfect , and there were a lot of times he dropped the ball on things . he did go to therapy and has worked on being a way better husband with a shiny backbone . but when he screamed at me about responding to his mom , ignoring that he himself gets to post whatever he wants , ignoring that he specifically told me i could respond to anyone in his family if they came at me , and ignoring that i specifically did not respond to anyone this entire time until right now . and it was such a benign argument between me and her before she blew up and called me hateful . so i brought up divorce . this lead to him calling his mother , telling her that there is no way he can have a relationship with her while she said horrible things to me . and i want to make it clear at this point i still was telling my husband that i did not want to ruin his relationship with his mom over me . i was still ok with him going to thanksgiving without me and everything . her response : she tried calling me numerous times . i didn't answer . she then messages me how am i supposed to supposedly apologize if you wont take my call then said turning point usa charliekirk ( i am literally not kidding i have the damn screenshot ) then said for ( husband ) , i am sorry for your pathetic and emotionally immature wife and the lonely life you will lead with just her , who severed the relationships with her only family and now yours . i responded and told her how even now i have not said anything hateful and she is being really cruel . then she said that i am the common denominator between my family having nothing to do with my and now his family having nothing to do with me . she knows everything that happened in my life . well , at that point this has pissed my husband off tremendously and he blocked her on my phone and his phone . he apologized to me for getting mad at me the night before . he said it was easier in the moment to try to blame me , but he really can't excuse the horrible things she said . and honestly , i am just shocked . her and i were always cordial . i never expected her to be my mom , i never expected her to treat me like a daughter . we were always on what i assumed were good terms . and this feels like it came completely out of left field . i am just so anxious and numb and honestly scared . i had no intentions of this happening with his family . it felt so sudden , and honestly felt very personal ? i told my husband that i will never respond to any of his family ever again when it comes to politics . i will let them say whatever weird and conspiratorial shit they want on my posts and i will either just delete the comments and just not respond . i am literally shook that the single only time i defended myself , this happened . i have been a big ball of tears all weekend . i am so angry that it is ok for them to say openly and freely whatever they want , even if it is full of conspiracies or straight up lies . but the moment i stand up about our free speech getting taken , i am a horrible monster . i feel so much anxiety , i never wanted any of this to happen . i always picked my battles and even now i was cordial and never called her names or anything at all . i know what's going to be said . i should have never posted a single political thing . i should have never engaged with her . and in hindsight , i know . i felt my posts were very benign . and i usually don't post anything political at all . but this has been a stressful 2 weeks . . they are all able to cheer on a horrible man who calls democrats like me demonic . but fuck me i guess",reddit,True

328,8,Abuse/Exploitation,"tw : severe child abuse the memories are flooding back and i'm overwhelmed . reaching out for help just made it worse . i always thought i had a bad memory , with no recollection of my life before ten . now , the memories are coming back in a flood , and it's overwhelming . i'm realizing the person i am was shaped by relentless , calculated cruelty from my parents , and i'm so angry . i need to write this all down . i need someone to tell me that this was as horrifying as it feels , because i'm starting to feel like no one can possibly believe it . it started when i was just a toddler . my mother's method of potty training was to violently slam me onto the potty , grab my hair , and shake my head while screaming at me to poop as i cried , unable to understand what she wanted . when i didn't hear her knocking because i was immersed in cartoons after she left me alone to go out she came back and beat me , punching and pinching me for being so stupid . when i finally peed after my circumcision , in pain and because the toilet was occupied , i peed in the hallway and was slapped for it . the abuse was creative and sadistic . before she started using a pvc pipe to beat me , she would run chili powder all over my face and nose as punishment . she never taught me what was right or wrong in a civil way ; it was always torture . she would pinch me so hard at family gatherings for being an energetic kid that i bruised , then pretend to hug me to comfort my tears in front of others . one day , she caught me inside a pillow fort i had made against the rules , and she suffocated me by pressing her entire body weight onto the pillows , with me trapped inside . her rage was constant and unpredictable . when i was young enough to have a lisp , she tried to teach me to pronounce letters , and after a few mistakes , she grabbed my hair and shook my head violently . years later , she did the exact same thing to my seven - year - old cousin , grabbing his hair , shaking him , and slapping him because he didn't understand her lesson . i think she just hates children . i was never allowed to be a child . on snowy days when every other kid was playing outside , i was forced to stay in and do homework . when i found joy in making origami , she would crush every creation i made and tell me to stop wasting paper . i was a picky eater , and her solution was eat or starve , leaving me underfed and skinny , only for my family to mock my body . the injustice was a constant theme . i was always blamed . when my cousin stole from my sister's piggy bank , my mother's first instinct was to chase me with her pvc pipe and beat me as hard as she could , only to later find out it was someone else . when my sister fell and got hurt while we were playing , i helped her to the house , and before even treating her wound , my mom grabbed my ear , shook my head , and screamed at me for being a jealous idiot . as i got older , the abuse evolved into pure sabotage and control . every gift for academic success was stripped away a month later , a lesson that they were the givers and takers . when i was 12 and qualified for a lan tournament , they didn't just say no they took my computer . at 15 , they contacted my employer and got me fired from my part - time job . at 17 , they took the phone i used for a small business i'd started . at 20 , during bovid lowdown , when i was scouted by a semi - pro team , they destroyed my pc . they systematically gaslit me about my friends , threatened them , and spread lies to isolate me completely , even turning my entire extended family against me . now , as an adult , the dynamic continues . my father is abusive towards my mom , and i became his physical and verbal punching bag for protecting her . i am still my mother's emotional support and the family's de - escalator . just recently , i asked my dad to turn his music down while i was working , and he attacked me , spit in my face , and told me i should have succeeded in killing myself . i finally broke today under the weight of these memories and the current abuse . i called a crisis hotline , crying , overwhelmed by vivid imagery of self - harm . when i explained what my dad did , the responder asked , why do you think your dad treats you this way ? it was the ultimate betrayal . it reinforced everything : that i'm the problem , that i deserve it . he put me on hold for 20 minutes . this has happened before with hotlines , on 7 cups , and on discord , where i've been ignored or met with womb womb and called a liar . i feel like my existence is too much for anyone to handle . but the scars on my body are real . the way my body flinches at memories is real . i need to know if anyone else has lived through this specific , relentless kind of hell . how do you survive knowing the people who were supposed to protect you were your greatest torturers ?

419,19,Political_controversial,"will the democratic party be forced to adopt some anti - immigration policies to return to power ? at the outset , i would note that i'm not asking about whether anti - immigration policies are subjectively good or bad - or whether immigration is good or bad for a country overall . i'm rather asking about political necessity ( or the lack thereof ) , given current american demographics and opinions . in particular , in the post - more of the last election , polling indicates that the second most important topic to swing voters was immigration . given that democrats lost all seven swing states , this seems politically significant . more recently , trump just announced a sharp fee to hire immigrants in the white collar world via h 1 b visas . while this policy will likely be abused by the administration - issuing exceptions to companies that toe the republican line , and applied to republicans' political enemies - initial reactions that i've personally seen appear cautiously optimistic . granted , i haven't seen any major polling on this yet to get a better idea of american opinion , but i'm getting the impression that people feel that even a broken clock like trump is right twice a day . i note these two things because they seem to represent a merging of blue collar and white collar interests . for years , blue collar workers have been repudiated by democrats for opposing low education immigration that competes with them for physical labor and trades . now , the white collar crowd seems to be making the same complaints about h 1 b visas . on the other hand , as a counterpoint against the ones i've outlined above , recent polling on the question of immigration doesn't seem as negative as election polling seemed to indicate . slightly under half of the country seems to feel that immigration rates should remain the same ( - with those advocating raising or lowering immigration rates being roughly split on each side . the country as a whole doesn't seem nearly as anti - immigration as recent events might have us believe . but , as a closing point , democrats may have to wrestle with an american electorate that is mostly neutral or positive towards immigration , but where swing state demographics are such that they still can't win without caving in on this policy . it's important for us not to forget that our election system is wonky and doesn't always give us what most people would seem to want . so the question is : will democrats be able to find a tightrope to victory in between these two merging factions , or will they be forced to change policies at the national level ? ( edit : a secondary question rears its head out of the treatment of this post - which has been downvoted literally to zero by people seemingly offended by the mere question . this tells us that there's a faction of people who are so bitterly opposed to changing this policy that they're willing to shoot the messenger for even raising the issue . how does that in turn impact the analysis ? )",reddit,True

443,3,Children_hate,"jealous of my time i had kids late at 42 and 44 . have a 4 and a 3 year old now . it's been half a decade ( since pregnancy ) and i don't know if it's possible to love my children and dislike having children . . . i always worked a lot in a demanding career and used my off work time to decompress , mostly by working out and reading . i feel that now i have little time to decompress between the end of the workday and being with them after daycare . i also have senior dogs i have to walk 60 - 90 min a day , so instead of working out i am giving my dogs some attention in their final years . then i get resentful because the girls go to bed between 8 : 30 and 9 : 30 - always waking up and whining for another 60 min afterwards . and , after reading them books in bed i get mellow and completely useless . i am so resentful . i wonder if it feels better when they just stop demanding your attention so much . i get angry when they call me or cry at night for no reason . this is not a good feeling to have . am i just not meant for this ? ps : we have a nanny , great daycare , and my husband is a fantastic stay at home dad . he takes care of their every meal , housework . i take care of finances , their health appointments and management , clothes shoes shopping , and also purchase most books . still , they call me whining and cry , throwing themselves at my feet , as if i was abandoning them , if i even try to cook in their presence instead of dedicating my full attention to them . i usually spend 3 - 5 hours taking care of them daily , plus full weekends . i feel very worn out . i just want to live without all this pressure every single day . i can't even go to the toilet without a child crying at the door . update : i love your guys responses , tips , care . i feel so looked after . thank you ! ! ! may god bless you ! for extra context : - i am a recovering workaholic with mild autism ( asperges ) , have hyperfocus and a lot of trouble with the toddlers noise - super high pitched yelling , overall speaking super loudly - and scattered minds . - my husband does the all the everyday food shopping and cooking , i only do it to decompress ( and because my cooking repertoire is better ha ) , he does an insane amount of laundry , cleaning after our pooping peeing alzheimer's dogs , picks up the girls , brings them to the park and extracurricular . our older child is special needs ( arid ) and has been on and off the hospital for most of her life until i dragged everyone to europe to get proper chronic illness healthcare ( it's working ! ! ! ) , which increases the workload but also the need for an available parent to hold on when she is at home sick .",reddit,True
444,4,Children_hate,"parent lied about my child pushing her child ? long winded so i apologize . my ( 29 f ) son is 5 and very close friends with another boy in his class , practically best friends . but for whatever reason , the boy s mother does t like me . i have tried to be friends with her and hang out , and she would say that we should , but i d never hear anything of it . and she barley smiles at me at school or talks to me although i try my best , so have just given up . after school they had gone to the park together once or twice with a few other mums at the beginning of reception preschool ( we are in the uk ) and that s it . we exchanged numbers at the beginning of reception and i had asked our kids to meet up in summer this year , and she told me she would let me know and asked how my summer was going . i responded and asked about hers , to no reply . since starting year 1 she told me that my son exposed himself to her son according to him and told me this in front of the other mums , so i was in shock and deeply apologized and practically blew up at my son . i spoke to the school who told me that he pulled down his trousers slightly while sitting to expose the back of his boxers and the kids were all laughing and being silly and that it was t a situation that needed addressing so they did t tell me , and that the child did t tell them anything in way of a complaint either . i was still furious with my son and told him to apologize and again apologized to the mum ( which made me think she 100 now had a reason to not like me ) . so i thought i d just avoid her at the gates as i m quite shy and non - confrontational and still felt embarrassed about what happened . but my son and her son still play together and are best friends and talk in the playground at drop off and my son talks about him all the time positively , so unless i have been told otherwise , no issues since . the next day after this happened she was incredibly overly smiley and nice to me which was odd and then back to awkward again the next day . then i get a message from her recently , telling me that she got a call from the school to say her son was pushed by another kid , banging his head and her son told her it was my son . so i deeply apologize and again , blew up at my son and made him apologize . i ask the school via class messages why i was t told about this , and they tell me that it was a clear accident and not on purpose so there was no need and dealt with in class . and they said when they spoke to the boy s mum to inform her ( they would t confirm the child s name or her name but we know it who it was ) they reiterated that it was an accident and that she was fully made aware of that . so then i message the mum to tell her that the school informed me it was an accident which is why i was t informed , but that regardless i have told my son to be more careful and apologize . she replies to say , aha oh , i was told by my child that your child pushed my child and a certain teacher confirmed this . glad to know it was an accident . so either she s dramatized this on purpose or the school are lying . i d feel weird telling her what the school told me to call out her lie , and clearly she does t like me hence stirring things up . but now i don t know how to navigate seeing her at school .",reddit,True
445,5,Children_hate,"help ! my 19 yo wants to get married . . . i just want to preface this by saying i in no way want to control my daughter or her decisions , i am just very anxious even though i kind of knew this was coming . she is an adult and i understand that . names have been changed . my daughter lily ( 19 ) plans to propose to her girlfriend on their anniversary at the end of the year . they met on twitter 4 years ago when jane ( 19 ) was still living in another state about 1000 miles away . there were visits back and forth for about 1 . 5 years . when they both graduated high school we allowed jane to move in with us so she could go to school here with lily . they are now in their second year of college . i only found out lily was planning to propose because she initially wanted her brother to help her get a particular ring box off ebay as she didn't get paid for a few days . so she asked me . i bought it . then ended up putting the ring on my credit card ( she is paying me back , something she has always been good about doing ) . i feel like i'm in a daze and my auto mode is just telling me to be supportive so i don't alienate her . but am i doing the right thing ? we had many conversations over the years about considering adult decisions ( moving out , getting married ) and making them from the place of planning and not impulsivity . that getting married too early would prevent us from helping to pay for college because it would make us ineligible to take out the loans needed . she seemed to hear us and i'm hoping that the plan will be to not get married until after they graduate . but i still think it's too young and that they both have a lot of growing up to do . there are also some relationship dynamics between them that really concern me as a lot of the burden falls on my daughter ( she is the only one with a license , a job , and the only one who cooks ) . this doesn't seem to bother her , but it bothers me a lot . i admit i am biased about young marriage . i was married at 19 to their father and he was a disaster of a man - child . he put me through literal hell for the last 5 years of our marriage and put my kids in some dangerous situations . the reality was that i wasn't mature enough to recognize red flags or that i was using marriage as a way to emotionally escape from my terrible childhood . i just want something better for my kids . any advice from parents of kids who married young would be most welcome . advice from anyone on how to navigate this would be very much appreciated .",reddit,True
